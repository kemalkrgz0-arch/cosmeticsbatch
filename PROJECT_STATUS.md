# CosmeticsBatch project status

Last updated: 2026-07-14
Current version: **0.2.2**
Current phase: **Phase 2 in progress — production email configuration pending**

This is the shared handoff document for maintainers and agents. Read it before
work and update it after every logical change group. Detailed audit evidence and
priorities live in `AUDIT.md`.

## In progress / operational blockers

- Resend production delivery is implemented but not live-verified.
- `cosmeticsbatch.com` must be added and verified in Resend with its generated
  SPF, DKIM and MX records.
- A sending-only `RESEND_API_KEY` must be placed in the server's untracked
  `.env.build`; never put it in this repository or chat.
- Production recipient: `contact@cosmeticsbatch.com`.
- After configuration, submit one controlled photo and verify attachment
  delivery, JSONL notification status, and direct reply through `Reply-To`.
- Resend domain verification is reported complete. A temporary API key is now
  present only in the git-ignored local `.env.build`; it still needs secure VPS
  transfer/deployment and must be rotated because it was shared in chat.
- Sender and recipient are both `contact@cosmeticsbatch.com`; no nonexistent
  `submissions@` mailbox is assumed.
- Phase 2 technical SEO/content integrity audit and fixes are in progress.
- Reviewed long-form locale coverage is now enforced from
  `messages/content/reviewed.json`; English and fully reviewed Russian content
  remain indexable, while unreviewed article translations remain accessible but
  are `noindex, follow` and ad-free.
- Brand/catalog/editorial/decoder-guide/review-manifest invariants are being
  added to the default regression suite.

## Completed — 0.2.0 (Phase 1)

### Decoder correctness and provenance

- Disabled unverified generic Julian fallback for unsupported brands.
- Added valid EAN/UPC/GTIN rejection before decoding.
- Fixed leap-year day 366 and L'Oreal current-month boundary behavior.
- Added verification profiles for all 18 registered decoders, with conservative
  confidence, source type, limitations and verification fields.
- No decoder is marked `VERIFIED` without a primary source and verification date.
- Added 12 regression/invariant tests covering all registered decoders.

### Data, SEO and advertising

- Replaced public hard-coded supported-brand counts with the central calculated
  value.
- Scoped advertising inventory/loading to reviewed, eligible pages.
- Corrected stale privacy and result-language claims found during the audit.
- Added the technical audit and prioritized findings to `AUDIT.md`.

### User photo submissions

- Added same-origin checks, rate limiting, size limits, file-signature checks and
  private filesystem storage outside `public/`.
- Client re-encodes images to JPEG to remove EXIF/GPS metadata.
- Added required reply email and explicit storage/contact/public-guide consent.
- Submissions persist in `submissions.jsonl` before any mail attempt.
- Added Resend notification with the photo attached and the user address in
  `Reply-To`; mail failure cannot discard the submission.
- Notification result is appended as `sent`, `failed`, or `not_configured`.
- Updated privacy and deployment documentation.

### Verification at Phase 1 handoff

- ESLint: passed.
- TypeScript `--noEmit`: passed.
- Decoder tests: 12/12 passed.
- Next.js production build: passed.
- Static generation: 264/264 pages generated.
- Real Resend delivery: **not run — credentials/domain verification unavailable**.
- `pnpm` wrapper attempted a registry/version check and failed in the restricted
  environment; the same lint/type/test/build commands passed through the checked-in
  local binaries. This is an environment issue, not a code failure.

## Next

### Phase 2 — technical SEO and content integrity

- Resolve remaining P0/P1 findings in `AUDIT.md` in dependency order.
- Audit canonical/hreflang/sitemap reciprocity across every active locale.
- Eliminate thin or duplicate programmatic brand pages unless verified,
  brand-specific value exists.
- Reconcile rendered FAQ content with FAQ JSON-LD.
- Complete brand/slug/parent-company and decoder-reference integrity checks.

### Phase 3 — primary user flow and accessibility

- Improve 200+ brand selection, keyboard navigation and mobile interaction.
- Clarify manufactured date, estimated unopened shelf life, PAO, confidence and
  limitations in result UX.
- Improve invalid, ambiguous and unsupported-code guidance.
- Add a review workflow/status process for photo submissions.

### Phase 4 — performance and security hardening

- Measure mobile Core Web Vitals and client bundle/hydration cost.
- Review CSP/security headers, third-party scripts and production rate limiting.
- Replace in-memory rate limiting if multiple replicas are introduced.
- Add retention/deletion procedures for submitted photos and reply emails.

## Shared change log protocol

For every future change, append a concise entry below with date, version, owner,
files, reason, verification and known risk. Never include secrets or personal data.

### 2026-07-14 — 0.2.1 — Codex / Phase 2 group 1

- Changed: limited About, Contact, Privacy and Terms hreflang/sitemap exposure to
  their only reviewed language (English); non-English renderings are now
  `noindex, follow` until translated and reviewed.
- Files: `src/lib/seo.ts`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, the four static route pages.
- Why: prevent English-only content from being advertised as 44 translated
  alternates and reduce mixed-language duplicate indexing.
- Verification: ESLint and TypeScript passed; production HTML confirmed English
  indexability and Turkish `noindex, follow`, with English-only hreflang.
- Risk / needs verification: external Search Console recrawl behavior must be
  observed after deployment.

### 2026-07-14 — 0.2.1 — Codex / Phase 2 group 2

- Changed: tied guide/decoder metadata, hreflang, sitemap alternates and ad
  eligibility to complete per-article review coverage.
- Files: `src/lib/content-review.ts`, guide and decoder detail pages,
  `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
- Why: generated translation files contain all 1,040 keys, but presence alone
  does not prove human review. Only English plus content explicitly approved by
  the review manifest should be promoted/indexed/monetized.
- Verification: ESLint, TypeScript and 12/12 decoder tests passed; production
  build generated 264/264 pages. Rendered HTML confirmed English and reviewed
  Russian are indexable/reciprocal, while unreviewed Turkish is `noindex,
  follow` and excluded from article hreflang.
- Risk / needs verification: the current manifest fully approves Russian; other
  locales will regain indexability article-by-article after editorial review.

### 2026-07-14 — 0.2.2 — Codex / Phase 2 group 3

- Changed: added default quality regression coverage for brand identity/core
  fields, decoder references, indexable editorial thresholds, exact sample
  decoding, decoder-guide coverage and content-review manifest integrity.
- Removed: the verified-unused static `HOME_FAQ` copy; the live homepage keeps
  one localized array shared by visible DOM and FAQ JSON-LD.
- Files: `scripts/quality-regression.test.ts`, `src/lib/faqs.ts`, `package.json`.
- Why: prevent new thin/indexable pages, orphan references and FAQ source drift
  from entering production silently.
- Verification: ESLint and TypeScript passed; expanded quality suite passed
  16/16; production build generated 264/264 pages.
- Risk / needs verification: parent-company factual accuracy still requires
  external primary-source review; structural consistency is now automated.

### 2026-07-14 — 0.2.2 — Codex / Phase 2 group 4

- Changed: made Article and Breadcrumb JSON-LD URLs locale-aware, centralized
  one breadcrumb schema in the visible Breadcrumbs component, removed duplicate
  BreadcrumbList output, and limited English-only HowTo JSON-LD to English.
- Files: `src/lib/seo.ts`, `src/components/breadcrumbs.tsx`, home, brand, guide,
  decoder detail and decoder index pages.
- Why: localized pages were declaring English structured-data URLs and some
  pages emitted the same breadcrumb schema twice; non-English HowTo text did not
  match the localized visible steps.
- Verification: rendered Russian guide, brand and decoder pages each emitted one
  localized BreadcrumbList and localized Article URL; Russian home emitted FAQ
  but no mismatched English HowTo. The first sandboxed build attempt failed when
  Turbopack could not bind its CSS worker port; the permitted rerun passed and
  generated 264/264 pages, confirming an environment restriction rather than a
  code regression.
- Risk / needs verification: HowTo can return to reviewed locales after its
  schema strings are translated from the same source as the visible steps.
